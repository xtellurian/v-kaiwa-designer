## Conversation and Interaction Designer

This tool helps you craft conversations as language learning tools. 

### Getting Started

#### Terminology

 - NPC: Non-player character. A character within the virtual world. You can interact and converse with NPCs.
 - Intent: The goal of a sentence. For example, the sentence "May I please have some help?" will have the intent "HelpMe".
 - Response: NPC's will respond to speech interactions in their own voice. Different intents will provoke different responses.

#### Available NPCs
 - Hot Dog Man: A man in a hot dog suit, who often sells hot dogs.
 - 

#### Available Intents

Intents are a distilled version of what a student is trying to say. It's a concept useful in creating and designing conversations. Currently the following intents are available:

 - HelpMe: The user is asking for help.
 - AskForItem: The user is requesting an item from an NPC. For example, "May I have a newspaper?"
 - GiveItem: The user is giving an item to an NPC. For example, "Here's your coffee"

### Downloading the content

Once you've designed your conversations, you can download the data file that will be loaded into the game. 
Currently, you must provide this file to V-KAIWA before it can be loaded into the game, but dynamic loading will be possible in the future.
