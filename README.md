### Using NVS for NodeJS

Download and install NVS from [here](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs/)

In cmd or powershell, run `nvm add lts`, which downloads the latest long term support node version.

Importantly, then run `nvs link lts`, which adds the lts node binary to the user path.

Check node is installed correctly by opening a new terminal/ cmd and running:


```
C:\Users\user>node -v
v8.11.2
```
